🌐 Built a mini News App in Python today!

➡️ I wanted to try out working with real-world data, so I used the NewsAPI.org and Python's requests module to fetch the latest news based on whatever topic I search. It was a fun challenge — from setting up the environment to figuring out how JSON works.

➡️ I didn’t follow a tutorial line by line — just explored, made mistakes, Googled stuff, and learned by doing. And now I actually understand how it works behind the scenes.

➡️ Super satisfying to see it come together!
