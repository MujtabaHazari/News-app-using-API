# News-app-using-API
🌐 Built a mini News App in Python today!  ➡️ I wanted to try out working with real-world data, so I used the NewsAPI.org and Python's requests module to fetch the latest news based on whatever topic I search. It was a fun challenge — from setting up the environment to figuring out how JSON works.
